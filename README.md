# ⏰ Alarm Timer Project

This is a **simple alarm clock script** written in Python. It takes user input for the duration of the timer (in minutes and seconds) and plays an alarm sound when the timer ends. 

## 🛠 Features
- 📅 **Custom Timer**: Enter minutes and seconds for a countdown.
- 🔔 **Alarm Sound**: Plays `alarm.mp3` when the countdown is complete.
- 🕒 **Real-Time Updates**: Dynamic countdown display in the console.

## 📦 Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `playsound` module: Install with `pip install playsound==1.2.2`

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Ensure you have an audio file named `alarm.mp3` in the same directory as the script.
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python alarm.py
   ```

## 🛠️ How to Customize
**1. Change Alarm Sound**: Replace alarm.mp3 with your favorite sound file.

**2. Modify Timer Behavior**: Edit the alarm() function to fit your specific needs.
